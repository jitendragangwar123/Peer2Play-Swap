### üõ† Requirements
Before you start, ensure that you have the following installed:
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/)

### ‚ö° Quickstart
Clone the repository and set up your environment:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/jitendragangwar123/Peer2Play-Swap
$ cd Peer2Play-Swap
$ make install
$ forge build
```

### üåç Deployment to a Testnet or Mainnet

#### 1. Setup Environment Variables

You'll need to set your `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL` and `PRIVATE_KEY` as environment variables. You can add them to a `.env` file in your project directory.

Optionally, you can also add your `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` if you want to verify your contract on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/).

#### 2. Get Testnet ETH

Head over to [faucets.chain.link](https://faucets.chain.link/) to get some testnet ETH. The ETH should show up in your MetaMask wallet shortly.

#### 3. Deploy to Sepolia Testnet

To deploy your contract to the **Sepolia** testnet, run:

```
$ make deploy ARGS="--network sepolia"
```

### üß™ Testing

You can run tests in various environments:

1. **Unit Tests**
2. **Integration Tests**
3. **Forked Network Tests**
4. **Staging Tests**

To run all tests, use:

```
$ forge test
```
or

```
$ forge test --fork-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL
```

### Test Coverage

```
$ forge coverage
```

### ‚õΩ Estimate Gas

You can estimate how much gas transactions will cost by running:

```
$ forge snapshot
```

And you'll see an output file called `.gas-snapshot`

### üìù Formatting

To run code formatting, use the following command:

```
$ forge fmt
```
